Tomorrow Night is Magic
=======================
This is a theme for sublime based on Tommorow Night Bright, with some color influences from Monokai.

Hot Pink everywhere FTW!

To install
----------
* Install the `Tomorrow-Night-is-Magic.tmTheme` file in the `Sublime Text 2 Packages/User` folder (on mac, that's `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User`)

* Select theme with `Preferences -> Color Scheme -> User`

Base16
-------
I also tried it with the base16-builder library (https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder), but that version still needs a lot of work.
